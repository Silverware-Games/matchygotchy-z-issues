# MatchyGotchy Z Issue Tracker

MatchyGotchy Z is the ultimate cozy pet raising sim. Hatch your pets, take care of them, grow them into Rocket Surgeons that take on the entire cozmos. Pets have personalities that you can grow and train based on advanced AI, and as your pets build stuff they can sell their work to make more zoot, the universal currency. Use this page to suggest features you want to see in the game, or point out bugs you may have found! Active members of the community get packets of merch sent to them.
